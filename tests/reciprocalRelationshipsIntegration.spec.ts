============================================================
NEW OBSIDIAN COMMANDS DEMONSTRATION
============================================================

🔍 NEW COMMAND: "Check reciprocal relationships"
   Command ID: check-reciprocal-relationships
   
   WHAT IT DOES:
   - Analyzes the current contact's relationships in the Related list
   - For each relationship, checks if the target contact has a reciprocal relationship back
   - Reports any missing reciprocal relationships
   
   EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
   1. Open contact file: "John Doe.md"
   2. John has: ## Related
                - parent [[Jane Doe]]
                - friend [[Alice Smith]]
   
   3. Run command → Checks:
      - Does Jane Doe have "child [[John Doe]]" relationship?
      - Does Alice Smith have "friend [[John Doe]]" relationship?
   
   4. Reports: "Found 1 missing reciprocal relationship. Jane Doe is missing: child -> John Doe"

🔧 NEW COMMAND: "Fix missing reciprocal relationships"  
   Command ID: fix-missing-reciprocal-relationships
   
   WHAT IT DOES:
   - Identifies missing reciprocal relationships (same as check command)
   - Automatically adds the missing reciprocal relationships to target contacts
   - Syncs the new relationships to both Related list and frontmatter
   
   EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
   1. Run command on "John Doe.md" 
   2. Finds missing reciprocal: Jane Doe needs "child [[John Doe]]"
   3. Automatically adds to Jane's file:
      - Adds "- child [[John Doe]]" to Jane's Related list
      - Syncs to Jane's frontmatter: RELATED[child]: name:John Doe
   4. Reports: "Successfully added 1 reciprocal relationship! 🎉"

RELATIONSHIP TYPE MAPPING RULES
============================================================
`);

    // Demonstrate the relationship mapping
    const asymmetricMappings = [
      ['parent', 'child', 'John is parent of Alice → Alice is child of John'],
      ['grandparent', 'grandchild', 'Bob is grandparent of Charlie → Charlie is grandchild of Bob'],
      ['auncle', 'nibling', 'Mary is aunt of David → David is nibling of Mary']
    ];

    const symmetricMappings = [
      ['friend', 'friend', 'John is friend of Alice → Alice is friend of John'],
      ['spouse', 'spouse', 'John is spouse of Jane → Jane is spouse of John'],
      ['sibling', 'sibling', 'John is sibling of Bob → Bob is sibling of John']
    ];

    console.log('📋 ASYMMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS (different reciprocal types):');
    asymmetricMappings.forEach(([type1, type2, example]) => {
      console.log(`   ${type1} ↔ ${type2}: ${example}`);
    });

    console.log('\n🔄 SYMMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS (same reciprocal type):');
    symmetricMappings.forEach(([type1, type2, example]) => {
      console.log(`   ${type1} ↔ ${type2}: ${example}`);

USAGE SCENARIOS
============================================================

📝 SCENARIO 1: Family Tree Consistency
   Problem: You add "- parent [[Mom]]" to John's contact, but forget to add
            "- child [[John]]" to Mom's contact
   Solution: Run "Check reciprocal relationships" to identify missing reciprocals
            Run "Fix missing reciprocal relationships" to automatically add them

📝 SCENARIO 2: Social Network Maintenance  
   Problem: You have "- friend [[Alice]]" in your contact, but Alice doesn't 
            have "- friend [[You]]" in her contact
   Solution: Commands will ensure friendship relationships are bidirectional

📝 SCENARIO 3: Professional Network Sync
   Problem: You mark someone as "- colleague [[Bob]]" but Bob doesn't have
            the reciprocal colleague relationship
   Solution: Automated reciprocal sync maintains professional network consistency

============================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  
============================================================

✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing relationship sync system
✅ Uses same relationship type normalization (gendered → genderless)
✅ Respects existing frontmatter format and indexing rules
✅ Maintains REV timestamp updates for changed contacts
✅ Provides detailed error reporting and logging
✅ Handles edge cases (missing contacts, invalid relationships)

DEMO COMPLETE ✅
